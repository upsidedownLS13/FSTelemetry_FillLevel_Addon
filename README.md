This example mod how to create add mods for the Farming Simulator Telemetry project. You can create (and share) as many addons as you like. The idea is to integrate other mods into the telemetry environment seamlessly.

Zip content and place in your FS "mods" folder.

Without the main mod, which you can find here: https://github.com/upsidedownLS13/FSTelemetry this mod does nothing.

Have fun building, driving and farming! :) upsidedown, April 2024
